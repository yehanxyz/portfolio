    <img class="post-img" src="https://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Towards-Sustainability-E-waste-In-The-Spotlight-On-International-E-waste-Day.jpg" alt="e-waste">

    <div class="post-content">
      <p class="content-text">
        Electronic waste, often known as e-waste, refers to electronic equipment that have reached the end of their useful life, have been replaced, or are nearing the end of their useful life. Computers, monitors, televisions, stereos, copiers,
        printers, fax machines, telephones, DVD players, cameras, batteries, and a variety of other electronic gadgets are among the most common. These discarded electronics can be resold, recovered, or recycled.
      </p>

      <p class="content-text">
        However, your old electronics are more than likely to build dust in a drawer or be put out with last month's uneaten leftovers. The problem with discarding these devices is that they are filling up our landfills, which could be hazardous.
      </p>

      <p class="content-text">
        When used, most gadgets are constructed with harmful chemicals and metals that are totally safe, but when discarded, they can cause major health hazards if they leach into the soil and groundwater when placed at a landfill.
      </p>

      <p class="content-text">
        According to the World Health Organization, the amount of electronic waste produced each day is increasing dramatically around the world, and recycling valuable elements contained in e-waste, such as copper and gold, has become a source of
        income, mostly in the informal sector of developing or emerging industrialized countries (WHO).
      </p>

      <p class="content-text">
        Computers and other electronics contain harmful compounds such as lead, zinc, nickel, flame retardants, barium, and chromium, which must be disposed of properly. Toxic elements can leach into the soil and ground water when electronic waste is
        buried in landfills, endangering not only our health but also the health of land and sea species.

        People in developing countries, where the majority of electronic waste is thrown, are the ones who are most at risk.

        E-waste is extremely hazardous during the summer months because when it is heated, poisonous compounds are discharged into the air, further deteriorating an already unstable environment; this is one of the most significant environmental
        effects of e-waste.

        Especially when it comes to lead. Lead can harm human blood, kidneys, and central and peripheral nerve systems if it is discharged into the environment.
